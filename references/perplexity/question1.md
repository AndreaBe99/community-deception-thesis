## Question 1
*I need to train an A2C agent, that given a node, add or delete edge to maximize a given function, but the actions allowed (i.e. the node that the agent can add or remove) are a subset of all actions and for each node this subset is different, so at each step of the training I need to change node to avoid overfitting and underfitting. But in this way the reward of the agent do not increase constantlu but goes random. What is a way to improve generalization? I have read for example, to use regularization for RL, how I can add it to my code, consider that the following code is class to train the agent?*

To improve generalization in your A2C agent, you can consider incorporating regularization techniques such as Implicit Regularization, RPC, and SMIRL. Here's how you can add regularization to your code:

1. **Implicit Regularization**: Implicit regularization is a technique that arises from the optimization process and the architecture of the neural network itself[2]. You can incorporate implicit regularization by using techniques like early stopping, dropout, or weight decay. To add weight decay, you can modify the optimizer in the `configure_optimizers` method:

```python
def configure_optimizers(self) -> None:
    actor_params = list(self.policy.actor.parameters())
    critic_params = list(self.policy.critic.parameters())
    self.optimizers['a_optimizer'] = torch.optim.Adam(
        actor_params, lr=self.lr, weight_decay=0.01)
    self.optimizers['c_optimizer'] = torch.optim.Adam(
        critic_params, lr=self.lr, weight_decay=0.01)
```

2. **RPC (Regularized Policy Optimization)**: RPC is a technique that adds regularization to policy optimization[6]. You can add RPC by modifying the `training_step` method to include an additional regularization term in the policy loss calculation. For example, you can add L1 regularization:

```python
def training_step(self) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    ...
    l1_reg_coef = 0.01
    for (log_prob, value), R in zip(saved_actions, returns):
        advantage = R - value.item()
        policy_losses.append(
            (-log_prob * advantage) + l1_reg_coef * torch.sum(torch.abs(self.policy.parameters()))
        )
        value_losses.append(F.smooth_l1_loss(value, torch.tensor([R]).to(self.device)))
    ...
```

3. **SMIRL (Surprise Minimizing Reinforcement Learning)**: SMIRL is a technique that encourages agents to minimize surprise in unstable environments[4]. To implement SMIRL, you can modify the reward function in your environment to include a surprise minimization term. This term can be based on the difference between the current state and the agent's prediction of the next state. You can then use this modified reward function in your A2C agent's training process.

By incorporating these regularization techniques into your A2C agent, you can improve its generalization capabilities and potentially address the issue of random rewards during training.

## Question 2
*I need to train an A2C agent, that given a node, add or delete edge to maximize a given function, but the actions allowed (i.e. the node that the agent can add or remove) are a subset of all actions and for each node this subset is different, so at each step of the training I need to change node to avoid overfitting and underfitting. But in this way the reward of the agent do not increase constantlu but goes random. What is a way to improve generalization? I have read for example, to use regularization for RL, how I can add it to my code, consider that the following code is class to train the agent, and the enviroment class? The technique that I have seen are: Implicit Regularization, RPC, and SMIRL.*

To add SMIRL regularization to your A2C agent, you can modify the `training_step` method in the `agent.py` file. SMIRL aims to minimize the surprise in the environment by encouraging the agent to visit states with low surprise. You can implement this by adding an additional term to the actor and critic losses that penalizes high surprise states.

First, you need to compute the surprise for each state. You can do this by calculating the difference between the current state's value and the average value of all states visited so far. Then, you can add a regularization term to the actor and critic losses that penalizes high surprise states.

Here's a modified version of the `training_step` method with SMIRL regularization:

```python
def training_step(self) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """Perform a single training step of the A2C algorithm, which involves
    computing the actor and critic losses, taking gradient steps, and
    resetting the rewards and action buffer.

    Returns
    -------
    mean_a_loss : float
        Mean actor loss
    mean_v_loss : float
        Mean critic loss
    """
    R = 0
    saved_actions = self.saved_actions
    policy_losses = []  # list to save actor (policy) loss
    value_losses = []  # list to save critic (value) loss
    returns = []  # list to save the true values
    surprise_losses = []  # list to save surprise losses

    # Compute the true value using rewards returned from the environment
    for r in self.rewards[::-1]:
        # calculate the discounted value
        R = r + self.gamma * R
        # insert to the beginning of the list
        returns.insert(0, R)

    # Normalize returns by subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation
    returns = torch.tensor(returns)
    if len(returns) > 1:
        returns = (returns - returns.mean()) / (returns.std() + self.eps)

    # Compute surprise for each state
    state_values = torch.stack([sa.value for sa in saved_actions])
    avg_state_value = state_values.mean()
    surprise = torch.abs(state_values - avg_state_value)

    # Add a regularization term to the actor and critic losses that penalizes high surprise states
    smirl_coeff = 0.1  # You can tune this hyperparameter

    for (log_prob, value), R, surpr in zip(saved_actions, returns, surprise):
        advantage = R - value.item()

        # Calculate actor (policy) loss with SMIRL regularization
        policy_losses.append(-log_prob * advantage + smirl_coeff * surpr)

        # Calculate critic (value) loss with SMIRL regularization
        value_losses.append(F.smooth_l1_loss(value, torch.tensor([R]).to(self.device)) + smirl_coeff * surpr)

    # Take gradient steps
    self.optimizers['a_optimizer'].zero_grad()
    self.optimizers['c_optimizer'].zero_grad()

    loss = torch.stack(policy_losses).sum() + torch.stack(value_losses).sum()
    loss.backward()

    self.optimizers['a_optimizer'].step()
    self.optimizers['c_optimizer'].step()

    # Reset rewards and action buffer
    del self.rewards[:]
    del self.saved_actions[:]

    return loss.item()
```

In this modified version, we compute the surprise for each state and add a regularization term to the actor and critic losses that penalizes high surprise states. The `smirl_coeff` hyperparameter controls the strength of the regularization. You can tune this value to achieve the desired balance between exploration and exploitation.

Remember to import any necessary libraries at the beginning of the `agent.py` file.
