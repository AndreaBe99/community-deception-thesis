## Node Deception

This documentation provides an overview of the `NodeHiding` class and related components in the Python module.

The `NodeHiding` module contains a class called `NodeHiding`, which is designed for evaluating the performance of an agent in the node hiding task. In this task, the agent's goal is to hide a node within a graph from a detection algorithm. The module also includes various baseline algorithms for comparison.

The key components of this module include:

- `NodeHiding` class
- Agent-related functionality
- Baseline algorithms (Randome, Degree and Roam)


## Community Deception

This documentation provides an overview of the `CommunityHiding` class and related components in the Python module.

The `CommunityHiding` module contains a class called `CommunityHiding`, which is designed for evaluating the performance of an agent in the community hiding task. In this task, the agent's goal is to hide a community within a graph from a detection algorithm. The module also includes various baseline algorithms for comparison.

The key components of this module include:

- `CommunityHiding` class
- Agent-related functionality
- Baseline algorithms (Safeness and Modularity)
