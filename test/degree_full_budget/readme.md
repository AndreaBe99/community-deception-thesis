# Folder Description

In this case, we adapt the Agent trained on the Community Deception task, assigning the full budget for the first node, which is the node with the highest degree in the community, and at each step, we decrease the budget by the number of actions performed in the previous step. 

This folder contains the files for three different datasets:
- `kar`, $\sim 40$ nodes;
- `words`, $\sim 100$ nodes;
- `vote`, $\sim 1000$ nodes;

For each dataset, we have used three different Detection Algorithms (our $f(\cdot)$ function):
- **Greedy Modularity**;
- **Modularity**;
- **Walk Trap**;

For each combination of dataset and Detection Algorithm, we have performed two different experiments:
- **Node Deception**: Hide a node from its initial community;
  - In this case we test the Agent on:
    - three different values of the *Similarity Coefficient* $\tau = \{0.3, 0.5, 0.8\}$;
    - three different values of the *Budget Multiplier* $\beta = \{1, 2, 3\}$ (budget is equal to $\beta \times \text{avg degree of G}$);
  - Each combination of $\tau$ and $\beta$ is tested for 100 iterations, and we obtain:
    - **Goal**, percentage of achieved goal;
    - **NMI**, Normalized Mutual Information, value between 0 and 1;
    - Average number of **steps** to hide the node;
    - **Time** to hide the node;
- **Community Deception**: Hide a community, i.e. a set of nodes, distributing the nodes in the community among the other communities;
  - In this case we test the Agent on:
    - three different values of the *Similarity Coefficient* $\tau = \{0.3, 0.5, 0.8\}$;
    - three different values of the *Budget Percentage* $\beta = \{1\%, 3\%, 5\%\}$ (budget is equal to $\beta \times \text{number of edges}$);
  - Each combination of $\tau$ and $\beta$ is tested for 100 iterations, and we obtain:
  - **Deception Score**, metric defined in the paper, value between 0 and 1;
  - **NMI**, Normalized Mutual Information, value between 0 and 1;
  - Average number of **steps** to hide the node;
  - **Time** to hide the node;
